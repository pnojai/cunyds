Mr. Hartnett's affable dimness disguises impeccable comic timing, and Mr. Ford does his loosest, wittiest work in years. The supporting cast is a goody bag stuffed with hip-hop strutters, mature bombshells and two bona fide music legends:  Gladys Knight and Smokey Robinson, who plays a put-upon cabdriver.

Val gets the job but when he starts filming, he comes down with a case of hysterical blindness and has to enlist  his agent, Al (Mark Rydell), to help.  When &quot;Hollywood Ending&quot; is  spitting  one-liners, the picture has the gone-delirious feel of Thelonious Monk crunching notes, a wired, jazzy rhythm specific to this comic.
