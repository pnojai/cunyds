## Notes

## Exercises
### Ex. 2.2.23
Write a program that picks a random number between 0 and 1 and computes the negative of its logarithm. Repeat this process a large number of times and plot a bar graph to give the number of times that the outcome falls in each interval of length 0.1 in [0, 10]. On this bar graph plot a graph of the density f(x) = $e^{âˆ’x}$. How well does this density fit your graph?

```{r}
trials <- 10000
x <- runif(trials)
x.neg_log <- -log(x)
plot(x, x.neg_log)
bins <- seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 0.1)

xtable <- rep(NULL, length(bins))

for (i in 1:(length(bins) - 1)) {
	xtable[i] <- sum(x >= bins[i] & x < bins[i + 1])
}

plot(x, exp(-x))
```
