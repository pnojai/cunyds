## Problem set 1
(1) What is the rank of the matrix A?

$A = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\-1 & 0 & 1 & 3\\0 & 1 & -2 & 1\\5 & 4 & -2 & -3\end{bmatrix}$

### Solution
The rank is the number of pivots. I'll row reduce the matrix and count up the columns with a leading 1.

```{r}
library(pracma)
A <- matrix(c(
	1, 2, 3, 4,
	-1, 0, 1, 3,
	0, 1, -2, 1,
	5, 4, -2, -3
), nrow = 4, byrow = T)

RREF <- rref(A)
RREF
```

It reduces to the Identity matrix. 

**ANSWER**: 4.

(2) Given an $mxn$ matrix where $m>n$, what can the maximum rank be? The minimum rank, assuming that the matrix is non-zero?

**ANSWER**:

- Maximum rank: $n$, the rank can be no greater than the smaller of the two dimensions.
- Minimum rank: 1. Only a zero matrix can have a rank equal to 0.

(3) What is the rank of matrix B?

$B = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & 1\\3 & 6 & 3\\2 & 4 & 2\end{bmatrix}$

### Solution
Row reduce the matrix and observe how many pivot columns the result has.

```{r}
A <- matrix(c(
	1, 2, 1,
	3, 6, 3,
	2, 4, 2
), nrow = 3, byrow = T)

RREF <- rref(A)
RREF
```

**Answer**: 1

## Problem set 2
Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix $A$. You’ll need to show your
work. You’ll need to write out the characteristic polynomial and show your solution.

$B = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & 3\\0 & 4 & 5\\0 & 0 & 6\end{bmatrix}$

### Solution

#### Eigenvalues
Solve the equation, $det(B - \lambda I_3) = 0$

$\begin{bmatrix}1 - \lambda & 2 & 3\\0 & 4 - \lambda & 5\\0 & 0 & 6 - \lambda\end{bmatrix} = 0$

$(1 - \lambda)\begin{vmatrix}4-\lambda & 5\\0&6-\lambda\\ \end{vmatrix} + 2(-1)\begin{vmatrix}0 & 5\\0 & 6-\lambda\end{vmatrix} + 3\begin{vmatrix}0 & 4-
\lambda\\0 & 0\end{vmatrix} = 0$

$(1-\lambda)((4-\lambda)(6-\lambda) - 5\cdot0)) - 2(0-0) + 3\cdot 0 = 0$

**Characteristic polynomial**

*Note: I elected not to distribute multiplication of the first term across the second, since it already gave me one of the factors I need for solving for the equality with 0.*

$(1-\lambda)(\lambda^2 - 10\lambda + 24) = 0$

$(1-\lambda)(\lambda-4)(\lambda-6) = 0$

$\lambda \in \{1, 4, 6\}$

#### Rule of Sarrus
I just learned the Rule of Sarrus, so I didn't have to do all that hand calculation of the determinant. I did do it, though, so now I have an alternative for checking my work. Let's take it from the top again, with feeling.

$\begin{bmatrix}1 - \lambda & 2 & 3 & 1-\lambda & 2\\0 & 4 - \lambda & 5 & 0 & 4-\lambda\\0 & 0 & 6 - \lambda & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}$

I wonder if you can typeset diagonal underlining in a matrix in \LaTeX. Here's what I'm doing.

- Start at element [1, 1]. Compute the product along the diagonal down to the right.
- Continue at [1, 2]. Add that product.
- Do that for $n$ products, $n$ being the number of columns of the original matrix, namely 3.
- Go to [1, 5]. Compute the product along the diagonal down to the left. Subtract it.
- Continue at [1, 4]. Subtract that product.
- Do that for $n$ products, namely 3 times.

$(1-\lambda)(4-\lambda)(6-\lambda) = 0$

That's it! That's the first diagonal. Every other diagonal evaluates to a product of 0. I'm sure [Beezer] has a theorem in there about upper triangular matrices and I missed it while he was making my eyes cross.

The Rule of Sarrus evaluates to the same factors I computed by hand, so I believe I did both calculations correctly. Moreover, there must be a theorem about the eigenvalues for a triangular matrix. The diagonal here is equivalent to the eigenvalues I computed two different ways.

#### Eigenvectors
We have $B$ and a set of eigenvalues. We're looking for eigenvectors, $v$, such that,

$Bv = \lambda v$

$(B - \lambda I_n)v = 0$

The vectors, $v$, which satisfy this equation for a given eigenvalue, $\lambda$, comprise the eigenspace for that eigenvalue, and it is the null space of the term on the left. The null space is the multiplicand yielding the product, 0.

$\mathcal{E}_B(\lambda) = \mathcal{N}(B - \lambda_n)$

The null space of that term is the same as the null space of its reduced row echelon form. Let's get that for the first eigenvalue, $\lambda = 1$. 

##### Eigenvalue = 1
```{r}
library(pracma)

B <- matrix(c(
	1, 2, 3,
	0, 4, 5,
	0, 0, 6
), nrow = 3, byrow = T)
B

lambda <- 1
B_e1 <- B - lambda * diag(3)
B_e1

# Augment with the 0 vector.
B_e1_aug <- cbind(B_e1, 0)
B_e1_aug

# Row reduce it to solve it.
rref(B_e1_aug)
```

Therefore,

$\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 & 0\\0 & 0 & 1\\0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}v_1\\v_2\\v_3\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}0 \\0\\0\end{bmatrix}$

- $v_1$ can be anything.
- $v_2 = 0$
- $v_3 = 0$

**Eigenpair**
$(1,\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix})$

Let's try this out. Each pair of products should equal one another.

```{r}
v <- c(1, 0, 0)
lambda <- 1
B %*% v
lambda * v

# Try another v_1.
v <- c(4, 0, 0)
B %*% v
lambda * v

# Another v_1.
v <- c(-1000, 0, 0)
B %*% v
lambda * v
```

##### Eigenvalue = 4
This time I would like to do a better job of representing the eigenspace.
```{r}
B
lambda <- 4
B_e4 <- B - lambda * diag(3)
B_e4

# Augment with the 0 vector.
B_e4_aug <- cbind(B_e4, 0)
B_e4_aug

# Row reduce it to solve it.
rref(B_e4_aug)
```

Therefore,

$\begin{bmatrix}1 & \frac{-2}{3} & 0\\0 & 0 & 1\\0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}v_1\\v_2\\v_3\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}0 \\0\\0\end{bmatrix}$

And,

$v_1 - \frac{2}{3}v_2 = 0$

$v1 = \frac{2}{3}v_2$

Let $v_2 = a$

$v1 = \frac{2}{3}a$

$v3 = 0$

**Eigenspace**

$\mathcal{E}_B(4) = \{\begin{bmatrix}v_1\\v_2\\v_3\end{bmatrix} = a\begin{bmatrix}\frac{2}{3}\\1\\0\end{bmatrix}\} | a \in \mathbb{R} \}$

*Note*: I tried to express the eigenspace like Sal Khan does it. Did I do it? I modified one thing per [Beezer] (who, surprising to me, made sense this time). I named the eigenspace with a subscript referring to its matrix and expressed it as a function of the lambda value. Khan puts the lambda value in the eigenspace subscript and I think you lose the reference to the matrix you're talking about.

Now I think the idea is that your eigenspace has many valid scalars. That's the "span," so I think I can just pick an $a$.

**Eigenpair**
$(4,\begin{bmatrix} \frac{2}{3} \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix})$

Let's try this out. Each pair of products should equal one another.

```{r}
lambda <- 4
a <- 1
v <- c(2/3, 1, 0)
B %*% (a * v)
lambda * (a * v)

a <- 7
B %*% (a * v)
lambda * (a * v)

a <- -452
B %*% (a * v)
lambda * (a * v)
```

**What do you know? It worked!**

##### Eigenvalue = 6
```{r}
B

lambda <- 6
B_e6 <- B - lambda * diag(3)
B_e6

# Augment with the 0 vector.
B_e6_aug <- cbind(B_e6, 0)
B_e6_aug

# Row reduce it to solve it.
rref(B_e6_aug)
```

Therefore,

$\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & -1.6\\0 & 1 & -2.5\\0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}v_1\\v_2\\v_3\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}0 \\0\\0\end{bmatrix}$

And,

$v_1 - 1.6 \cdot v_3 = 0$

$v1 = 1.6 \cdot v_3$

Let $v_3 = a$

$v_1 = 1.6 \cdot a$

$v_2 - 2.5 \cdot v_3 = 0$

$v_2 = 2.5 \cdot v_3$

$v_2 = 2.5 \cdot a$

**Eigenspace**

$\mathcal{E}_B(6) = \{\begin{bmatrix}v_1\\v_2\\v_3\end{bmatrix} = a\begin{bmatrix}1.6\\2.5\\1\end{bmatrix}\} | a \in \mathbb{R} \}$

**Eigenpair**
$(6,\begin{bmatrix} 1.6 \\ 2.5 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix})$

Let's try this out. Each pair of products should equal one another.

```{r}
lambda <- 6
v <- c(1.6, 2.5, 1)

a <- 1
B %*% (a * v)
lambda * (a * v)

a <- -23
B %*% (a * v)
lambda * (a * v)

a <- 42
B %*% (a * v)
lambda * (a * v)
```

## Conclusion
That was pretty painful. I got it all to work, but it felt like a lot of hand waving while I was going through it. I think if I go back and review the material, I'll understand it better, be less nervous, and I can work through some more problems.
